# Fast Complementary Filter for Attitude Estimation Using Low-Cost MARG Sensors
This algorithm is proposed by Jin Wu, Zebo Zhou, Jingjun Chen, Hassen Fourati and Rui Li, which presents a novel fast approach for attitude estimation using gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer. Related Paper has been published as a regular paper on IEEE Sensors Jounral. Please download the PDF file at http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2016.2589660.

The source codes are written with C++ programming language and are complied by Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Comunity.

Raw data file 'flat_motion2.txt' is included for algorithm's computation while the results are verified using MATLAB software with respect to gold reference angles acquired from an MicroStrain 3DM-GX3-25 Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS). 

This code can only be adopted for personal use. If any commercial use is involved, please contact: jin_wu_uestc@hotmail.com or klinsmann.zhou@gmail.com for further information. 

Anyone who uses the codes for academic research should refer to the following citation: "J. Wu, Z. Zhou, J. Chen, H. Fourati and R. Li, Fast Complementary Filter for Attitude Estimation Using Low-Cost MARG Sensors, IEEE Sensors Journal, 2016".
